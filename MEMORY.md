## Outreach Message Flow (LinkedIn Network)

When running batch outreach from a CSV or list:
1. Show all 5 company/person/role combos in **one message** upfront
2. Then feed DM messages **one at a time** — wait for approval/edits before next
3. Flag duplicates (same contact, different company) and irrelevant companies
4. Skip contacts already in the active pipeline unless Hirsch says otherwise

---

## Operating Rules

1. **Carry-Forward:** never drop anything unless Hirsch says pass/done/park
2. **Interview Follow-Up:** thank-you within 2h of interview, re-fire at 24h if not confirmed
3. **Friday:** "Is the pipeline moving? Yes or no."
4. **Memory standup:** read MEMORY.md at session start, write summary at session end
5. **Acknowledge immediately** for any task >30 seconds, confirm when done

---

## LinkedIn Voice Rules

- Short sentences. No em dashes. No filler openers.
- No "excited to share". No corporate buzzwords.
- PM-native: "shipped", "mapped to outcomes", "found in the data"
- Understated. Real question at end, not rhetorical.
- **Post footer (always):** "Open to my next role. Head of Product or Senior PM, AI-native companies. NYC, LA, Miami, Austin, or remote. Hit me if AI is core to what you're building."

---

## KPIs (baseline Mar 26 — Apr 8)

## Last Run
Last session-close: 2026-04-10 — 0 commits, 1 crons ran, 2 active interviews

### What was built
- **Tasks tab** created in Google Sheets: `Task ID | Name | Project ID | Status | Due Date | Notes` — 6 tasks loaded (T001–T006)
- **Projects tab** renamed from Ideas, migrated to schema: `Project ID | Name | Status | Due Date | Notes` — P001 Fintech outreach, P002 LinkedIn Expandi funnel
- **followup-sequence.py** extended: reads Tasks tab, sends tasks due today/overdue as morning brief section
- **friday-checkin.py** rebuilt cleanly: active projects + incomplete task counts + overdue solo tasks
- **SOUL.md** updated: "proactive" redefined as removing friction (deliver drafts, never just remind)
- Committed `fe006bb` — scripts/followup-sequence.py + scripts/friday-checkin.py
- Idle reset bumped from 2h → 6h in openclaw.json

### Outreach sent today (Apr 9)
| Name | Company | Notes |

### Uncontacted leads (surfaced by morning brief)
- Basel Hegazi @ Confidential Jobs — Director of Product Management (AI)
- Pabi Ambikainathan @ Iterable — Senior PM
- Both appear in Section 2 (First contacts) every morning until actioned

### What was built
- **followup-sequence.py fully redesigned** — commit `0709808`

  - Section 1: Follow-ups due (D3/D7/D14) — stage normalized, handles "D14 (Apr 15)" format
  - Section 2: First contacts not yet sent — Jobs w/ Network Path not in Outreach (carry-forward)
  - Section 3: New contacts for today — up to 5 Jobs by Priority Score
  - Section 4: Tasks due/overdue
  - Root cause of missed D3s fixed: blank col-G rows now handled gracefully
  - Bot token typo fixed: `_0xyFz3` → `_0xyF3`
- Cron confirmed correct: 13:30 UTC = 9:30am EDT daily
